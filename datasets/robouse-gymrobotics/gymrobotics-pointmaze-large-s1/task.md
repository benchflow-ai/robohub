You are controlling a simulated robot. Read the task below, then solve it by running the `robo` command in your shell (start with `robo info` and `robo observe`). Keep going until the task is done, then call `robo done` once. Do not stop to ask questions; there is no human to answer.

# Point Maze: large maze (seed 1)

A small ball moves on the floor of a walled large maze, pushed by a force you choose (adapted from Gymnasium-Robotics, `PointMaze_Large-v3`, start/goal seed 1).

**Goal:** Roll the ball through the maze to the goal.

Success: the ball centre comes within 0.45 m of `goal_pos`. The episode ends as solved the moment this happens (you do not need to stop on the goal or call `robo done` afterwards).

In `robo observe`: `agent_pos`/`agent_vel` are the ball's position (m) and velocity (m/s), `goal_pos` is the goal (shown in red in camera images; the ball is green), and `maze_rows` is the maze layout, one string per row from the top (+y) row down: `#` is a wall block, `.` is free floor. `cell_size` is the width of one cell in metres, `cell_center` gives the world coordinates of the centre of cell (row, col), and `agent_cell`/`goal_cell` are the [row, col] cells the ball and goal are in. Walls fill whole cells; the ball (radius 0.1 m) cannot pass through them. Camera images are top-down with +x to the right and +y up.

**This task uses a 2-D action.** `robo act FX FY [--repeat N]` applies a force (each in [-1, 1]) to the ball along world x and y for N steps of 10 ms each; the ball keeps its momentum, so brake by pushing the other way. `robo move-to` and `robo grip` are disabled here, and the `DX DY DZ GRIP` form in the general instructions below does not apply.

## How to control the robot

You are the robot's policy. You act only through the `robo` command in your shell. There is no other way to move the robot, and you cannot read or change the simulator, the scoring, or other files to succeed; the episode server judges the final physical state itself.

```
robo info                         # action space, available skills, step budget
robo observe                      # robot and object state as numbers
robo observe --image              # also saves a camera image and prints its path (open it to look)
robo act DX DY DZ GRIP [--repeat N]   # low-level action, applied N times (N <= 50)
robo move-to X Y Z [--grip G]     # skill: move the gripper toward a point (if enabled for this task)
robo grip G [--steps N]           # skill: hold position and set the gripper (+1 close, -1 open)
robo done "short summary"         # end the episode and ask for scoring
robo give-up "reason"             # end the episode without claiming success
```

- Positions are in metres in the world frame (x, y on the table plane, z up).
- The episode has a fixed step budget (see `robo info`); every simulated step counts, including skills.
- Unless the task says otherwise, success is judged about 10 steps after you call `robo done`, with the robot holding still, so the goal must still be true when the robot stops.
- Work in small steps and re-observe after each motion. Call `robo done` exactly once when finished.
