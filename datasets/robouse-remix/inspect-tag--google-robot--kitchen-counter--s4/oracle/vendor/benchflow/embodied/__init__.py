"""Embodied rollouts: the low-level layer for robot and simulator tasks. See docs/embodied.md.

  spec        Embodiment: sensors, action groups, skills, budgets (one schema for every robot kind)
  backend     SimBackend: the contract a simulator implements
  protocol    the episode wire protocol (JSON over a Unix socket)
  robo        the agent-facing `robo` command (standard library only; copied into agent images)
  server      EpisodeServer: budgets, recording, judging, roles, per-step trace
  skills      built-in arm and gripper controllers
  serve       `python -m benchflow.embodied.serve --factory module:function ...`
  sidecar     EmbodiedTaskFormat: materializes tasks as native packages with a simulator sidecar
  verifier    the physical verifier (runs in the simulator service)
  export      training export of episode records
  rollouts    seeded rollouts: pass@k, variance, reset reproducibility

This package imports nothing else from BenchFlow, so simulator images can vendor it (sidecar.vendor_embodied).
